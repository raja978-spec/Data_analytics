1. What is numpy?
* A package used to do numerical calculation on N dim
  array.
* Used for machine leaning, data science areas
* It supports array, matrices and variety.

2. How do i create a numpy array?
Using 
*np.array()
*np.zero(shape, dtype) and oness
*np.full(shape=(4,4), fill_value=[i for i in range(2*2)])
OUTPUT:
[[0 1 2 3]
 [0 1 2 3]
 [0 1 2 3]
 [0 1 2 3]]
* np.arange(start=1, stop=10, step=2)
OUTPUT: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
* np.linspace(start=[1,2,3],stop=[4,5,6],num=3)
OUTPUT:
[[1.  2.  3. ]
 [2.5 3.5 4.5]
 [4.  5.  6. ]]

3. What are the main features of Numpy?
* Memory management
* Board casting
* supports multi dimensional array
* Has indexing and slicing

4. How do you calculate the dot product of two NumPy arrays?
Using numpy.dot(a,b) function
Using the @ operator
a @ b
a: The first input array (NumPy array).
b: The second input array (NumPy array).
Both methods will return the dot product of the 
two arrays as a scalar value.

5. How do I access elements in a NumPy array?
In NumPy, we can access elements in an array by indexing and slicing.
And by boolean indexing: helps to select elements with condition

6.What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in NumPy?
shallow - shared same data with same address space, so the data is not
          duplicate. So changes made in one will reflected on other one
deep - Completely new copy in new memory space, so changes made in 
       this will not be reflected to original one.
