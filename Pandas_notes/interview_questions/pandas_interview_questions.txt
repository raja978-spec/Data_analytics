1. What is pandas?
Package helps to do data manipulation, analysis, cleaning.
handling missing values in fast manner.
Built on top of numpy

2. What are the Different Types of Data Structures in Pandas?
Series - 1D labelled array can hold any data type.
DF - 2D tabular form data, has row, columns 

3. List Key Features of Pandas.
Easy handling missing values
Integrated with numpy
Reshape of data is Easy
Has group by functions

4. What is series.
A Series in Pandas is a one-dimensional labelled array, can hold any 
data types, A series can be created from a Python tuple, list and dictionary.

5. What are the Different Ways to Create a Series?
* Creating a Series from an Array
* Creating a Series from an Array with a custom Index
* Creating a Series from Dictionary
 dict = {'Geeks': 10,
  'for': 20,
  'geeks': 30}
  # create series from dictionary
  print(pd.Series(dict))
OUTPUT:
Geeks    10
for      20
geeks    30
dtype: int64
* Creating a Series using NumPy Functions
# series with numpy linspace()
  ser1 = pd.Series(np.linspace(3, 33, 3))
  print(ser1)
# series with numpy linspace()
ser2 = pd.Series(np.random.randn(3))
print("\n", ser2)
OUTPUT:
0     3.0
1    18.0
2    33.0
dtype: float64
 0    0.694519
1    0.782243
2    0.082820
dtype: float64

7.How can we Create a Copy of the Series?
shallow - ser.copy(deep=False)
deep - ser.copy(deep=True)
